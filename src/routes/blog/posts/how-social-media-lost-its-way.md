excerpt: How social media went from a tool for connection to a force that divides us.

When social media first appeared, it felt like a gift—simple, warm, and sincere. It reconnected us with childhood friends we thought we'd lost forever. It kept families close despite borders. It gave ordinary people the extraordinary ability to share their lives with the world. It made our voices louder and our distances smaller. And it did all of this for free, wrapped in the promise of a kinder, more connected world.

In those days, the internet felt like a modest neighborhood café where everyone gathered. We posted without filters, wrote without fear, laughed without calculating who might see it, and carried our online presence lightly. Social media was a companion, not a compass.

Yet as years passed, that gentle invention evolved into something unrecognizable—something that changed how we see ourselves, how we interact with others, and how we understand truth. What began with good intentions grew powerful enough to reshape entire societies, and in that transformation, it sprouted consequences its creators never imagined.

## The Quiet Birth of a Second Life

As platforms expanded, they slowly carved out a parallel reality—a virtual life that ran alongside our physical one. At first the two lived in harmony, but gradually the digital self began demanding more attention. We learned to present ourselves not as we were, but as we wanted to be perceived. The more we shared, the more curated our lives became, until authenticity gave way to performance.

Likes and comments, harmless in the beginning, soon formed a subtle currency. They measured our worth, our belonging, our social standing in a world that existed only on screens. The pursuit of these tiny validations pushed us to refine, edit, and polish even the smallest of moments. Life stopped being something we lived and became something we staged.

And without fully realizing it, the platform built for connection became an arena for comparison.

## When Reality Wasn't Enough

Once comparison took hold, reality began to seem insufficient. People felt compelled to embellish their stories, beautify their photos, and exaggerate their achievements. Everyone online suddenly appeared to be an expert, an artist, a philosopher, an activist. Ordinary life looked dull next to the highlight reels others posted. The pressure to appear extraordinary—to impress, to shine—grew relentless.

It became normal to see flawless skin, exotic vacations, perfect relationships, and unending success. We forgot that we were looking at carefully selected fragments, not an entire truth. The platforms that once celebrated everyday moments began rewarding the fantastical, the polished, the unreal.

## The Descent Into Self-Doubt

As feeds filled with perfection, many began feeling the weight of inadequacy. Quiet questions brewed in the back of our minds:

- Why is everyone happier than me?
- Why is everyone living a better life?
- Why am I the only one struggling?

Research began to confirm what millions were feeling. Studies across the world now show that heavy or compulsive social media use is tightly linked to rising levels of anxiety, depressive symptoms, emotional distress, and low self-esteem—especially among adolescents and young adults. The mechanism is painfully simple: we compare our unfiltered lives to the edited realities of others, and naturally, we lose.

Sleep suffered too, eroded by late-night scrolling and the harsh glow of screens. Restless nights became restless minds. And restless minds are rarely kind to themselves.

Even identity—a cornerstone of youth—became vulnerable. Teens reported feeling shaped and judged by a digital audience they barely knew. Many experienced harassment, hostility, or outright bullying, often leading to withdrawal, loneliness, or in the worst cases, suicidal thoughts. What was meant to bring people together quietly became a machine capable of isolating them.

## The Invisible Hands Behind the Screen

While we navigated our own crises of self-worth, another transformation was taking place behind closed doors. Algorithms—vast, calculating, exquisitely precise—began to monitor everything we did: every click, every pause, every hesitation. Their job was simple: understand us better than we understand ourselves and keep us engaged for as long as possible.

To do this, they tracked our preferences, predicted our desires, and arranged our feeds to match our beliefs. The intention was not sinister; these systems were built to make our experience smoother, more relevant, more enjoyable. Yet the outcome was profound. By feeding us what we already liked, they gradually closed us off from opposing viewpoints. Echo chambers formed. Polarization deepened. Civil discourse weakened.

Meanwhile, misinformation began to spread at a velocity no newspaper or broadcaster could ever match. Content no longer needed to be true; it only needed to be shareable. Entire societies felt the effect of this shift. Public health decisions, political movements, and cultural debates became vulnerable to distortions and half-truths circulating at light speed.

Social media, once a bridge, began functioning as a funnel—narrowing perspectives, reinforcing biases, and leaving little room for nuance.

## The Attention Economy and Its Hunters

As individuals sought validation, corporations sought profit. They recognized that human attention had become the most valuable commodity on earth—and social media held it in the palm of its hand. Advertisers rushed in, each determined to outshine the other, using every psychological trick the platforms allowed.

- Clickbait headlines
- Manipulative layouts
- Disguised ads
- Endless notifications designed to pull us back in

Ethics became optional. Engagement became the only metric that mattered.

We were no longer users but targets—pulled into a digital hunting ground where our focus, our impulses, and even our emotions could be monetized.

## A Tool That Outgrew Its Intentions

Looking back, the arc becomes painfully clear.

Social media began as a humble tool to connect humanity. It slowly became an amplifier of our insecurities. Then a filter that distorted reality. Then a machine that learned how to influence our behavior. And finally, a force powerful enough to shape the beliefs of entire societies.

None of this was planned. The platforms grew faster than we learned how to navigate them, and the consequences grew even faster than the platforms themselves.

This is not the story of a villain. It is the story of an invention that outpaced its creators and overwhelmed its users. A mirror that reflected too little and magnified too much. A promise that transformed into a pressure.

We embraced social media believing it would make us more connected, more informed, more united. Instead, without noticing, we became more anxious, more divided, more lost.

The tragedy is not that social media exists—it's that we forgot its purpose.

Connection is meant to humanize us. Not exhaust us. Not divide us. Not manipulate us.

What began with good intentions became a force we must now learn to understand, question, and use with care. Only then can we return to the simple vision that started it all: people reaching out to people, not profiles reaching out to algorithms.

PS: I wrote this post as an answer for anyone who asks why I don't use social media. I originally named it "The new age cancer". But it felt like may be I was being too much dramatic about it. Hence the new title.
