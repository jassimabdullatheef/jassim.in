I’m not a professional photographer—just an enthusiast who enjoys the craft. But even as an amateur, photography has quietly reshaped the way I see the world. What follows are reflections from that perspective.

## Learning to See

The word photography comes from the Greek phōtos (light) and graphé (drawing). In the simplest sense, it means drawing with light. And while we often talk about cameras, lenses, and all the expensive gear, the truth is that these are just instruments. Pressing a shutter doesn’t make someone a photographer any more than holding a paintbrush makes someone an artist.

What matters is the eye behind the tool—the curiosity, the intuition, the creative mind.

Our eyes are far more sophisticated than any camera ever built. Before a camera captures anything meaningful, we have to notice it first. We have to learn how to recognize beauty in ordinary places, how to pay attention. Professional photographers often say that photos are made in the mind before they’re made with the camera. And they’re right: every image is the result of countless mental choices—about light, mood, framing, emotion, and story.

## Being in the Moment

Seeing a scene deeply means noticing edges, patterns, shadows, rhythms, relationships, balance, and emotion. It sounds like a lot, but these things build naturally with practice. Slowly, you begin to tune in—to the world, to yourself, to the moment.

Ironically, photography can also pull us away from the moment if we’re not careful. In The Secret Life of Walter Mitty [sn: One of those movies I recommended to anyone and everyeone], Sean O’Connell says, “If I like a moment, I don’t like to have the distraction of the camera.” That line captures something profound: sometimes the best photograph lives only in the heart. Part of learning to be a better photographer is knowing when not to take the shot.

## Cultivating Empathy

Whether it’s portraits, wildlife, or travel photography, understanding your subject matters. The more connected you are, the more honestly you can tell their story.

Empathy—truly seeing and feeling with someone else—is one of the most powerful tools any photographer can have. It shapes the way we approach subjects, the way we wait for the right moment, the way we frame emotion. And beyond photography, empathy is simply a cornerstone of being human.

## Entering the Details

Every subject that enters a frame carries a story. Sometimes it’s loud and obvious—a gesture, an expression, an action. Other times the story hides in small details: a wrinkle, a shadow, a scattered object, a glance. Details give photographs depth. They make them breathe.

Photographers are storytellers, and the challenge is to create an image that can hold a thousand words—an image that invites the viewer to lean closer, notice more, feel more.

## The Quiet Gift of Photography

Training yourself to see like a photographer transforms more than your photographs. It transforms your life. You become more observant. You notice beauty in unexpected places. You pay attention to details you used to overlook. You become present.

And maybe that’s the real gift: photography doesn’t just help us capture the world—it helps us truly see it.

PS: I don't take much photographs as I used to do due to personal reasons (being lazy is one of them) but I find the
perspective shift happened within me is still present with me.
